# Sample Xcode Project
## iOS App - Calculator 🧮
This Xcode project was written with a TDD approach *(Test Driven Development)* to create a layered structure to build a calculator app. 

The architectural layers are the models, the calculator brain *(business logic)* and the presentation layer (UI - User Interface). Using a layered system means that we can build upon a strong foundation just like we would with a tall skyscraper building. This project was built writing the small lower level calculator brain first and then applying a visual layer on top of it. This allows for seperation between the platform presenting the software and the software itself. Oh.. and it's highly testable too!

## Use The Tools Of Professionals
If you want to learn Swift then make sure you are using the tools the proffesionals use within the iOS industry. They use [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) to build apps writing the code using the [Swift programming language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html).

## Learn Swift First
Building apps is the secondary part of learning iOS development. First, we must learn how to use the tools and write the language and then we learn how to use those tools. 

You'll need an understanding of Swift in order to pass an interview! But you may find companies are willing to teach you app development based on your Swift skills alone!  

The order of our learning:
  1. how to write Swift in Xcode
  2. how to architect an iOS app in Xcode. 

## Our Services
We made the official Swift documentation searchable. [Try it](https://github.com/MatthewpHarding?tab=repositories&q=SWIFTDOCS+hello+world). Our aim is to optimise career growth for juniors learning iOS by teaching Swift via our online courses. We have taken the official Swift documentation and **simplified it** for fast learning. 😎

💡 **Top Tip**: During an iOS interview they'll ask questions about Swift, not iOS! To BOOST 🚀 your career forwards become an expert of the Swift language.
